				<h2>My current goals are as follows:</h2>
				<ul>
					<div class='module'>
						<li><h3>1. Set more timed practiced for PHP and JavaScript (when applicable) and measure success by way of exercises from memory.</h3>
						<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> This goal will be accomplished when I am able to complete given exercises in a certain time without difficulty. If I get stuck for more than 5 minutes, I have not reached my goal.</p></li>
					</div>

					<div class='module'>
						<li><h3>2. Build a small website each week to practice CSS grid and flexbox.</h3>
						<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> When I can construct a website each week with at least a header, section and footer with CSS flex and grid for at least 2 breakpoints, I have met my goal.</p></li>
					</div>

					<div class='module'>
						<li><h3>3. Continually seek feedback from other students on current projects.</h3>
						<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Apply the suggestions / corrections from others and weigh it against the unedited work. Make note of what has changed and why it has changed.</p></li>
					</div>

					<div class='module'>
						<li><h3>4. Confidently demonstrate answers to potential interview questions so that I may land a career with a desired company.</h3>
						<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> When I get to this point, I would like to run mock interviews with Derek. If I am uncertain with answers, I can seek help afterward. However, I can also use this as a time to show that I am flexible and willing to learn concepts I might not know yet.</p></li>
					</div>

					<div class='module'>
						<li><h3>5. Write at least one blog post per week outlining my work and progress.</h3>
						<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> I can hold myself accountable by setting reminders to post the blog weekly and share it with the group / on my personal site. </p></li>
