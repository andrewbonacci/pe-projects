		<h2>My journey so far...</h2>

			<h3>September 28, 2021</h3>

			<p>The past few weeks have certainly been an adventure. I am so thankful to be a part of this progressive course and this group of talented people. I appreciate the fact that I am learning from the ground up, taking things step by step in order to build a solid foundation regarding programming and web development. I have collaborated with students, collected visual inspirations and worked with staff every step of the way so far. I'll be documenting my journey as it continues, so I welcome you to join along!</p>
